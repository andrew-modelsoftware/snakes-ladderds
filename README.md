# Snakes and Ladders game library

Tested Node version 12

### Run the tests
```
npm install
npm test
```

### Notes
* There is a highlevel public game interface that contains the functionality to provide game funtionality, this has a bunch of todos that would be implemented in the final library
* The game engine contains most of the logic for passing the features and ACs in the challenge
* Additional actors/features I would provide if I continued with challenge: 
  * GameFactory to return game object with all dependencies
  * Examples file to show how to use the library
